# A simple GenAI pipeline

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gameliee/AssignmentAF/blob/colab/pipeline.ipynb)

## Development note 

- Please use `pre-commit`
  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  ```

- Branch `colab` is for editing in Google Colab. Since Colab commit directly without the `pre-commit`, a workflow is set to help it by automatically run `pre-commit` for every commit to this branch.
