# A simple GenAI pipeline

## Development note 

- Please use `pre-commit`
  ```bash
  pip install pre-commit
  ```

- Branch `colab` is for editing in Google Colab. Since Colab commit directly without the `pre-commit`, a workflow is set to help it by automatically run `pre-commit` for every commit to this branch.
